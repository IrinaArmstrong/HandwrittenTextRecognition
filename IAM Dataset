The data-loader expects the IAM dataset (or any other dataset that is compatible with it)
in the data/ directory. Follow these instructions to get the dataset:

1) Register for free at this website.
2) Download words/words.tgz.
3) Download ascii/words.txt.
4) Put words.txt into the data/ directory.
5) Create the directory data/words/.
6) Put the content (directories a01, a02, ...) of words.tgz into data/words/.
7) Go to data/ and run python checkDirs.py for a rough check if everything is ok.
